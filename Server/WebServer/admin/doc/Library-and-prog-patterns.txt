Page edit modes:

- Nothing (no edit field specified) - render page a first in
- Edit=2: perform save or commit from edit, then return to non-edit mode
- Edit=3: save and stay in edit mode






SQL Examples:

Subquery:

select type, matchnum, teamnum from match_team where matchnum  in 
(select matchnum from match_team where teamnum = '3006') group by teamnum order by matchnum;


select  teamnum from match_team where matchnum in (select matchnum from m
atch_team where teamnum = 3006 and  matchnum > 38) group by teamnum order by tea
mnum;



Using self-join (join in the same table) to compare values of two rows and bring back matches:


select  b.teamnum, a.matchnum from match_team a, match_team b where a.type=b.type 
and a.matchnum=b.matchnum and a.color=b.color and a.teamnum=3006 
group by teamnum order by teamnum,  matchnum;

Brief instructions on setting up a MySQL, PHP, apache web server for the competition system.

1. Check params file for database name, user, password


2. Install MySQL, apache, then php.
     In MySQl, check option for including path in windows directory
     In apache, note admin/root password (for later use)
     In php, configure with apache 2.2 and extensions MySQL and MysQLi extension 

3. Create the database:
   mysqladmin create competition -u root -p
   
   This prompts for password to root given in install.  Now the dbfile is created.

4. Grant access

    mysql -d competition -u root -p
 
    mysql>  grant all on *.* to 'compuser'@'localhost' identified by 'password';

5. Run freshdb.bat in admin\data directory

6. Config apache:


  Setting up automatic reading of main.php:
  Change DirectoryIndex:
    DirectoryIndex index.html main.php index.php


  Setting up password access:
  In <Directory> in main config (current) or setting up for a file-based .htaccess:

   AuthUserFile "C:/Program Files/Apache Software Foundation/Apache2.2/admin/htpasswd.master"
   AuthName "Red Rock Robotics Competition System"
   AuthType Basic
   require valid-user
 


7. Test php and db connection. Under htdocs/webhome, goto ./Test and try phpinfo.php and dbtest.php.

8. May need to enable firewall for port 80 access on vista/Windows7.  
     Go to control panel, firewall.  In advanced, add port 80 access.


Test system. Browse to home and try it out.  Try editing, then run freshdb when done.

"SURROGATE matches will be marked with an ""*"" to the right of the SURROGATE Team's Number. The Audience defense selection group is rotated once per round of MATCHES. A round of MATCHES equals the total number of MATCHES divided by the number of MATCHES per Team rounded down to the nearest whole number. Due to the MATCH Assignment criteria (per FRC Game Manual, 5.3.2), it is possible for a team to not play with a particular audience selection in one round, and play with another selection twice in a different round.
